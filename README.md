# Astro Familiarization Project

This project was a familiarization with the JavaScript web framework, Astro. By loosely following the tutorial, exploring available options, and debugging, I learned how to generate a fun and engaging theme, gained practice with HTML and CSS, and had a blast organizing changes and seeing my updates immediately in the side by side environment in Firebase. This was a fun opportunity to experiment and build some skills that I want to use for a future project!
